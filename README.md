# VS Code Minecraft Parkour

## What is this?

[Chances are](https://www.businessinsider.com/sludge-content-gen-z-hooked-tiktok-2023-4) [you've seen](https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/sludge-content-1.6716185) ["sludge content"](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/sludge-content-tiktok-escapism-rcna77037) [on platforms like](https://www.polygon.com/23649389/tiktok-sludge-content-subway-surfers-attention-span-hasanabi) YouTube Shorts, TikTok, or Instagram Reels. These videos overlay otherwise monotonous content on clips from games or TV shows. The background clip improves retention by providing an additional visual stimulus. Rather than scrolling on to the next short, the watcher switches their focus to the background clip and back.

This extension applies the same philosophy to your code. Do you find yourself getting distracted and switching windows while working? Now, you can find a distraction right within VS Code.

2. Run the `Overstimulate` command from the command palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P` or `⌘ + ⇧ + P`)
